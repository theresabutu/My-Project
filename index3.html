    <h2>Method of Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel Irish potato, cut, wash, put in a drain basket to drain excess water, sprinkle some salt. Fry in hot vegetable oil until fried... I like my chips really dried so I fry it for a long time. Set aside!</li>
        <li>Break your eggs in a bowl, add onions,chopped carrot, fresh pepper, yellow, green pepper, mashed garlic, add a seasoning cube  and or salt (I like using seasoning cubes to fry my eggs) add little curry powder, then whisk your egg to combine all ingredients evenly.</li>
        <li>Put a frying pan on fire,add some vegetable oil, allow to get hot, the pour your egg mixture. Fry on low heat, flip the other side of the egg to fry as well. Fry until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Your breakfast is ready! Serve the chips hot with the fried eggs and tomato ketchup. Enjoy!</li>
